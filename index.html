        <h1>Quoc (Kiu) L.</h1>
        <h2>Front-End Web Developer</h2>
        
        <p>Kiu graduated with a Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering in 2006. Since then, he had a +10-year career as a Project Manager in the energy and construction sector. In 2020, Kiu decided to become a Web Developer. This is not a complete change as Kiu's training as an engineer, the soft skills he developed, and his work experience will be an asset in a Web Development career.</p>
        <p>Kiu used Lynda.com's online education modules to build strong fundamentals in HTLM5, CSS, and JavaScript. Although learning is a lifelong pursuit, Kiu now has a solid foundation of responsive layouts using Flexbox and Grid layout. He is also able to design web pages with accessibility in mind. Kiu looks forward to joining a team to put his education into practice and have a fulfilling career in Web Development.</p>
