							<h3>Web App: Q-Story</h3>
							<p>
								This is a web app that tracks tasks. This tracker is used to
								monitor more complex tasks than to-do lists, but less complex
								than longer term 'project' like tasks. This project has sign-in
								security. Tasks will only be displayed if it is related to the
								user. The user and task information is persisted using a NoSQL
								database. The displayed task list can be ordered and filtered.
								Each task can have user created or automated comments.
							</p>
							<p>
								To demo this project, can using in with the following
								credentials: Login: 1@1.com or 2@2.com or 3@3.com or 4@4.com
								Pass: 123123 The first 2 log-ins has higher editing privileges
								(supervisor level), while the last 2 log-ins have lower
								privileges (worker level). The worker levels have less
								privileges to edit existing tasks. You can also register and
								create your own account. Although email verification is not
								currently implemented, it can be easily added.
							</p>

							<p>
								The project demonstrates Kiu's ability to use popular web
								development tools. The project uses React for the front-end with
								Bootstrap v4.5 for styling. Firebase services (Authentication,
								Firestore, and Hosting) provides the back-end services for this
								development. The repository contains a functions folder that
								starts to explore using Google Cloud Functions. However, it is
								not yet integrated into the main production code. The reason not
								to implement Cloud Function in this project is because Firebase
								requires the Blaze plan (pay as you go) instead of the Spark
								plan (free) in order to use Cloud Functions.
							</p>

								The project is hosted on Google Cloud Hosting. The project
								webpage and the source code are available here:

								A webpage is coded using HAML (HTML abstraction markup

								framework, the code is cleaner as compared to the code generated
								by more popular layout frameworks, such as Bootstrap.This

								Bootstrap, to demonstrate Kiu’s solid foundation is semantic
								HTML and CSS.

								This website is inspired by Kiu’s friend, who wishes to have a
